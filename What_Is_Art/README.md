## Isosceles Right Triangle - a new poetic form
This Isosceles Right Triangle poetic form has a shape of isosceles right triangle in the end. Addressing the side length of the triangle at the first place will be the main factor of it.

* The words number of the first line will be the length of the side triangle.
* The last line of the poem will be only one word.
* The first word of each line starts from a phone of AA1 R (referencing art)
