Using markov chain to mess up with some already messed up drunk texts


#### Using individual characters as one unit, aka char_level_generate
#### Some good ones when n = 4
Depending on the n number of n-gram, the result varies, what I found is that when n = 4 gets me the "best" result in this case.

#### When n is less then 4, it is too drunk to read
##### n = 2, even TextEdit complains

##### n = 3, I waterly fire, you come

#### Using word_level_generate was not as good but is still funny
