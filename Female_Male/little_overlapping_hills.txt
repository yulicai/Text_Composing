Little Overlapping Hills - Qingzhao Li of Song dynasty

Spring returns to my lonely chamber, 
Once more spring grass is lush and green.
Some red plum blossoms are open,
Others have yet to bloom.
I grind tea bricks into fine jade powder
In a pot carved with azure clouds, 
Still under the spell of the morning's dream,
Till all of a sudden I am woken
By a jug of spring. 
Flower shadows press at the double gate,
Pale moonlight silvers the translucent curtains.
A beautiful evening!
Three times in two years 
We've missed the spring.
Come back without further ado
And let's enjoy our fill of this spring!
