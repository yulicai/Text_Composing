The above is the poem I made in the end.<br /><br />

It has two original texts. Both of them are translated from ancient Chinese poems. One poet is male and the other is female.<br /><br />

The poem composed by the male poet is called Bring In The Wine; The poem composed by female poet is called Little Overlapping Hills. Here they are.<br /><br />

## The process I made the final poem. 

* Use textblob to identify the tags of words, like noun, verbs.
* Create a python function file to count the top 10 words that show up the most in each poem.
* Create another python function file, that combines the tow word list I made together by adding a “:” in between them.<br />

The command I used in command line. The actual function python files attached after these.

* python wordCount_textBlob_tag.py <bring_in_the_wine.txt >male.txt
* python wordCount_textBlob_tag.py <little_over_lapping_hills.txt >female.txt
* python combineTwoFiles.py male.txt female.txt >final.txt
