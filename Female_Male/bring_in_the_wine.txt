Bring in the Wine Ôºç Li Bo of the Tang dynasty

Have you not seen the Yellow River waters flowing from Heaven,
Rushing to the sea, never to return?
Have you not seen parents' sorrow in their white hair?
Once, it was like black silk at dawn, now at sunset it's like snow.
A life fulfilled must contain happiness:
Never let the golden vessel go empty, just add the moon!
Born with Heaven's gifts, I must use them
I've scattered thousands in gold and it all returns to me.
Boil the mutton, butcher the ox, all for joy
Muster a draught of three hundred cups
Master Cen and Master Danqiu,
Bring in the wine, the ceaseless cups.
Just one more song for you,
Please just listen closely.
Bells and drums, delicacies and jade? All nothing!
I just want one long binge, not sobriety!
Old sages and worthies? All forgotten!
Only great drunks leave behind their names.
Prince Chen once feasted in the Temple of Tranquil Joy,
Worth tens of thousands, casks of wine indulged every pleasure.
So how dare I say my money is running out?
Go buy more wine and fill our cups.
My fine dappled horse, my precious furs,
Call over the servant boy, exchange them for rare wines.
Together we'll wash away ten thousand old sorrows.
