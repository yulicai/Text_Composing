I want to paint sky thats, You go.
I want to hold thats life, You rise.
I want to rise unnatural men machine men, You hold.
I want to hold cold society, You hear.
I want to despair proud individuals, You breathe.
I want to breathe wonderful adventure, You let.
I want to hear sky thats, You hold.
I want to make oh oh oh oh, You despair.
I want to make harsh reality mass confusion spoon, You let.
I want to define sky thats, You paint.
